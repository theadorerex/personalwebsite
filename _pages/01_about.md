_ ~~ I leave you my dream. ~~ Osho Rajneesh ~~ _

Hello,

I am called Bennett, and this is my dream world.


Have you ever lay in bed for a long time and let your thoughts run wild?

Sometimes, they go to weird places and become quite vivid. If you let this go on for a while, you can land in a dream!

Has this ever happened to you? Or if not, have you ever become so immersed in a book or a movie that you had to “snap back to reality” when it was finished?


I’ve had both of these experiences, and they feel very similar to me: at first ideas or characters have rational relationships to each other and to the history of other stories. But over time, these thoughts give way to imagination, and I sink into the story-world.

This experience is called a dream when it is caused by old ideas already stored in the brain. But when it is caused a movie or a book, the ideas come from someone else’s mind. This is called art, and it is a very deep type of communication.


This website is a place for me to practice writing, with the ultimate aim of deep communication. Hopefully after your time here, new ideas will swirl around in your head. They’ll become a part of your body, and influence the shape of your own dreams.


Thank you for exploring here :)
