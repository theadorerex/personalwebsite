One of the best lessons I learned from my friend [Shantji][shantji] is to always have a resting thought. When nothing needs to be done, return your attention to some predetermined object of focus. This is basically 24/7 mindfulness meditation, and it helps the body relax throughout the day.

Most meditation teachers will tell you, “It doesn’t matter where you rest your attention, just pick something and stick with it.” But I’m here to say, not all resting thoughts have the same effect on the body.

Scientists have been studying humans’ split-second reactions to situations for years. These studies have been the subject of NY Times best-sellers like, Blink; Before You Know It; and Thinking, Fast and Slow. I read Before You Know it a few months ago. And most of the book described the results of studies on [“priming”][priming].

The idea is that two groups of participants are put into the same decision making situation, but their experiences before that decision are different. It turns out that things as subtle as holding a warm beverage have a statistically significant effect on people’s decision making. 

Researchers say that these subtle differences before the decision “prime” us to act in a certain way. For instance, holding a cup of warm coffee primes people to feel more secure and be more generous than holding a cup of cold coffee.

When you pick your resting thought, it is priming you. The brain navigates to some schema — in the case of meditative focus, the brain goes to a place below ideas. When the brain comes back to the world of ideas, who knows what will happen? If you are a secular person, the idea of concentrating on your breath may not prime you to be any more generous than you would be otherwise.

Could you make your resting thought something explicitly positive? Is that even possible, long-term?

The TV personality, Mr. Rogers, seemed to have an answer to that question. Whenever he had an opportunity to make a speech, he would ask the audience to take one quiet minute to think about the people who inspired them and helped them become who they are today.

Take a minute.

What if this became the resting thought?

Loving. Nurturing. You are welcome and secure in this family. And there are things that you can do to enhance this family.

Try it out, and enjoy.



P.S. This seems to be what the Dalai Lama is recommending with his emphasis on loving-kindness, no?
